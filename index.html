    <h1>To Julianna:</h1>
    <p>
        You are the light of my life and you mean the world to me.<br />
        For the last seven months, and even before then, you have made me the happiest man on the planet.<br />
        Your beauty, kindess, and generosity has touched not only my heart, but the heart of many others as well.<br />
        My life is so much better with you in it, and I am excited to spend even more of it alongside you.<br />
        You and your family have shown me love beyond anything I could ever dream of, and for that I am very grateful.<br />
        You are loved to the furthest stars in the sky and back, and I am extremely proud to call you mine.<br />
        I love you, Julianna.

        - With all my heart,<br />
        Justin
